Following along with Peter Norvig's List interpreter from
http://norvig.com/lispy.html

I'm up to the end of blog post 1, with some minor improvements, such as:
Some slightly more helpful error messages on encountering invalid source code
(although I don't plan to venture far down that rabbit hole). Also I improved
built-in operators + and * to accept multiple arguments.


Dependencies
------------

  * Written on MacOS but should be portable.
  * Python 3.2


Usage
-----

::

    lispy [<options>] <program_file.ls>

<Options> may include any of:

    --version | -v
        Display version number and quit.
    --help | -h
        Display usage information and quit.


Known Issues
------------

All very seat-of-the-pants.


Thanks
------

Peter Norvig for creating Lispy and blogging about it.
